# Script Name: get-iso-ubuntu22.sh
#
# Description:
#   This script downloads the official Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) cloud image
#   in QCOW2 format and places it into the default libvirt image directory.
#   It avoids redundant downloads by checking if the image already exists.
#
# Parameters:
#   (None)
#
# Behavior:
#   1. Checks if the QCOW2 base image file (`ubuntu-2204.qcow2.base`) already exists in `/var/lib/libvirt/images`.
#   2. If not found, downloads the latest Ubuntu 22.04 cloud image from:
#      https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/jammy/current/jammy-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
#   3. Moves the downloaded file to `/var/lib/libvirt/images/` and renames it.
#   4. Sets appropriate ownership and permissions for use with libvirt.
#
# Requirements:
#   - wget
#   - sudo privileges (to move the file and set permissions)
#   - libvirt should be installed and configured
#
# Output:
#   The image will be saved as:
#     /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-2204.qcow2.base
#
# Example Usage:
#   ./get-iso-ubuntu22.sh
#
# Note:
#   This image is intended for use in cloud environments and includes `cloud-init` by default.
